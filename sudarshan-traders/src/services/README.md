# Services

This directory is intended for abstracting business logic and interactions with external APIs or data sources. Services can encapsulate functions for fetching, creating, updating, or deleting data, and can be used by components, hooks, or other parts of the application to interact with the backend or third-party services. This helps to decouple data fetching and business logic from the UI.
