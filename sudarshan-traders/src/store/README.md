# State Management Store (Zustand)

This directory holds state management stores, primarily using Zustand. Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution. Each file in this directory might represent a separate store or a slice of the application's global state. This helps in managing complex state interactions and making state accessible across different components without prop drilling.
