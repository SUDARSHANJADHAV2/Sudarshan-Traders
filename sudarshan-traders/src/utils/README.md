# Utility Functions

This directory is for general-purpose utility functions that are used across various parts of the application. These functions should be generic and not tied to specific business logic or UI components. Examples include functions for date formatting, string manipulation, data validation, or other common helper tasks.

Keeping utilities here helps in code reuse and maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
